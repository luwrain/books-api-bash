lwr-json: Simplifying JSON output

You can put the output of lwr-books-... utilities through lwr-json to decode 
JSON data and make it more readable. Please note that this utility obscures some character, so it is not intended
to be used somehow in production scripts implying high level of reliability.
lwr-json uses the jq utility, please ensure you have installed it in your system.
