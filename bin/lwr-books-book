$THIS: Printing information about the book
Usage:
  $THIS BOOK_Id

Prints the information about the book by its ID either in the repository (about the audiobook) or
in the library (about the book text, ready for synthesizing the voice data). You should provide a bookID, which you can get 
by running lwr-books-repo, lwr-books-collection or any other utility listing the books in various categories.
